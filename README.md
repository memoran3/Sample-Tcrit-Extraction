# Sample-Tcrit-Extraction

This repository contains sample R code and data files that can be used to extract Tcrit values from temperature and F0 data. Please use the input file in this repository (“Example_F0”) as this code is for demonstration purposes only and may not work with other input files. This repository also includes a sample output file and plot to preview what the code will execute, and the code can be modified to extract Tcrit with other types of input files and data formats.
